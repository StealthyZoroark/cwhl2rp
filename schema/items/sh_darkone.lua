Well.. where do I begin? These monsters.. They.. They will haunt your soul! Do not get to close to them!

If you see one.. Kill that bastard! DO NOT hesitate! Now.. Do not under estimate these creatures.. They.. They
can get inside your mind.. Turn you inside out mentally.. Wish you never even lived!

If you have found this book.. I am already dead.. Trapped in an unknown demension.. Please listen to me..
These creatures are not to be messed with!
